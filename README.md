#R Markdown analysis script
## Description
The R Markdown script is used for creating the figures and analusis used in the publication "Resource asynchrony and landscape homogenization as drivers of virulence evolution: the case of a directly transmitted disease in a social host" by Tobias Kürschner, Cédric Scherer, Viktoriia Radchuk, Niels Blaum and Stephanie Kramer-Schadt.
It performs various data processing and analysis tasks on the raw data generated by the IBM model SwiFColBM_Evo.

## Prerequisites
- Required R packages installed (see `source_lib.r` for package dependencies)

## Usage
1. Set up the R environment by running the setup chunk at the beginning of the script.
2. Modify the file paths in the script to point to the correct input and output directories.
3. Run each chunk sequentially to perform the desired data processing and analysis tasks.
4. The final output will be saved in the specified output folder.
